<br>Tempest: Lee Sin smashes the ground, sending out a shockwave that deals 70/105/140/175/210 (+100% bonus Attack Damage) magic damage. If Tempest hits an enemy, Lee Sin can cast Cripple for the next 3 seconds.
<br>Cripple: Lee Sin cripples nearby enemies struck by Tempest for 4 seconds, slowing their Movement Speed by 20/30/40/50/60%. Movement Speed recovers gradually over the duration.
